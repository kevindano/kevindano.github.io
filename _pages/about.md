Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of California Berkeley.  

My research interests are primarily in econometrics, with a focus on panel data and networks. I have also worked on topics in political economy. Here is my [CV](files/CV_Kevin_DANO.pdf).

**I am on the 2023-2024 job market.**
