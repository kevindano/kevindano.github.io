<br />
Welcome! I am an econometrician with research interests primarily in panel data and networks.

I will join Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in July 2024, and as an Assistant Professor of Economics in January 2025. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Here is my [CV](files/CV_Kevin_DANO.pdf).
